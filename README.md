# React interview exercise

## Demo https://react-interview-exercise.now.sh/

### Homepage (class-based)
1. Request first 10 images (https://picsum.photos/v2/list?page=1&limit=10)
2. Save images to the local state and display all images on the homepage (3 images in a row grid)
3. Make infinite scroll for the homepage to load more images (page=2,3,4...)
4. Add new route for the Image page (/image/id)

### Image details page (react hooks)
1. Request detailed information about image (https://picsum.photos/id/{id}}/info)
2. Represent detailed information in the markup
3. Navigate from "Related Images" to another image details page

### Image detailed view 
1. View the original image un the popup with abilities to zoom in/out and close the popup

### additional improvements
- You don't need to make some spinners or loaders, just hide content while loading
- Responsive layout will be a plus
- Double click to like image (or suggest the approaches)
- Nice animations will be a plus
